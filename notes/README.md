These are the notes from the 6.033 course at MIT taken online
or while reading the course textbook. The first 2 folder
that corresponds to L1, and L2 have been done not in class
but by book reading, for this reason, there are some
concept that overlaps with the other lecture that
have been taken in class, and then read in the book.

This is one of the first time that I took notes for every
lecture and I hope that writing the thought about what
I listen and understand will be useful for the learning
process.

This course has been taken as the real start for computer
engineering and with the idea that it will be the predecessor
of other courses like performance engineering and operating
system engineering.

In this course, you will encounter a lot of interesting
and fundamentals concepts that are at the foundation of the
computer engineering therefore unmissable for a good
software engineer education.
