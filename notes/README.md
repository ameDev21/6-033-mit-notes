This are the notes of the 6.033 course at MIT taken online
or while reading the course textbook. The first 2 folder
that corrisponds to L1, L2 have been done not in class
but by book reading, for this reason there are some
concept that overlap with the others lecture that
have been taken in class, and then readed on the book.

This is one of my first time that i took notes for every
lecture and i hope that writing the though about what
i listen and understead will be useful for the learning
process.

This course has been taken as the real start for computer
engineering and with the idea that it will be the predecessor
of others courses like performance enginnering and operating
system engineering.

In this course you will encounter a lot of interesting
and fundamentals concepts that are at the foundation of the
computer engineeering therefore unmissable for a good
software engineer education.
